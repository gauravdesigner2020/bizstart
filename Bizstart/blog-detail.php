							Once you decide to take the entrepreneurial path, the next vital question that you need to address is “What type of business do I start?” This article seeks to guide you through the process of choosing your business, how to f gure what you exactly want to do.
						</p>
						<p>
							But before we get started, let us clarify one point upfront. You might wonder whether this is a good time to launch your business. The reality is that there’s never a bad time and ‘NOW’ is as good a time as ever to start your entrepreneurial venture. While it is smart to launch when the economy is looking up, it is equally intelligent to get started when the economy is not doing its best.

							Playing to your strengths is fundamental to cracking the code to success.

						<p>
							2. Find the right customer

						<p>
							‘You are in the business of f nding the right customer’ it cannot be any closer to the truth
